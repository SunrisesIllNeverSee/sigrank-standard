## Authority of Every Major Path

| Path | Authority | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `SPEC.md` | **Normative** | The authoritative specification. All other documents defer to it. Contains all MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements with stable IDs. |
| `TERMINOLOGY.md` | **Normative** | Canonical definitions of all terms used in SPEC.md. Terms defined here are binding. |
| `PRIVACY.md` | **Normative** | Privacy mode definitions and content-independence requirements. Binding on all implementations. |
| `SECURITY.md` | **Normative** | Security considerations, threat model, and reporting process. |
| `GOVERNANCE.md` | **Normative** | Governance process, maintainer roles, OEP lifecycle. Binding on contributors. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | **Informative** | How to contribute. Not normative but follows governance rules. |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | **Normative** | Community behavior standards. Binding on all participants. |
| `TRADEMARKS.md` | **Normative** | Trademark usage rules. Binding on anyone using the protocol name or marks. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | **Informative** | Version history. Not normative but must be accurate. |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-EXPERIENCE.md` | **Informative** | Registry of known implementations. Not normative but must be truthful. |
| `ARCHITECTURE-DECISION-MEMO.md` | **Informative** | Design rationale. Not normative; explains why decisions were made. |
| `OPEN-COMMERCIAL-BOUNDARY.md` | **Normative** | Defines what is open and what is commercial. Binding on the ecosystem. |
| `ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md` | **Informative** | Roadmap. Not normative; subject to change. |
| `BUSINESS-MODEL.md` | **Informative** | Commercial model reference. Not normative; describes one possible business approach. |
| `RISK-REGISTER.md` | **Informative** | Risk tracking. Not normative but should be maintained. |
| `BACKLOG-30-60-90.md` | **Informative** | Implementation backlog. Not normative; operational document. |
| `UNRESOLVED-DECISIONS.md` | **Informative** | Open questions. Not normative; tracks decisions pending approval. |
| `schemas/` | **Normative** | Machine-readable schemas. Binding on implementations that claim conformance. |
| `metrics/` | **Normative** | Metric registry and definitions. Binding on implementations that compute metrics. |
| `profiles/` | **Normative (when adopted)** | Privacy modes are normative. Application profiles are optional but normative when adopted. |
| `examples/` | **Informative** | Examples illustrate the spec but do not define it. Fixtures in `examples/fixtures/` are normative test vectors. |
| `test-vectors/` | **Normative** | Test vectors are binding — implementations MUST produce the expected results. |
| `conformance/` | **Normative** | Conformance runner and class definitions. Binding on conformance claims. |
| `reference/` | **Informative** | Implementation maps and provenance. Not normative. |
| `adapters/` | **Normative (when adopted)** | Provider adapter definitions are normative when an implementation claims adapter conformance for that provider. |
| `oeps/` | **Normative (when accepted)** | Accepted OEPs are normative. Draft OEPs are informative. |
| `integrations/` | **Informative** | Reference implementations demonstrate conformance but do not define it. |
| `python/` | **Informative** | Python package is a reference implementation, not normative. |
| `docs/` | **Mixed** | GLOSSARY, LIMITATIONS, CONFORMANCE are supplementary. PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE is informative context. |
| `rfc/` | **Deprecated** | Superseded by `oeps/`. Retained for history. |
| `.github/workflows/` | **Normative** | CI gates are binding on the repository itself. |

## Design Principles

1. **Single source of truth:** `SPEC.md` is authoritative. All other documents defer to it.
2. **Machine-readable where possible:** Schemas, registry, test vectors, and adapter definitions are JSON.
3. **Separation of concerns:** Normative requirements are in root files and `schemas/`, `metrics/`, `conformance/`, `test-vectors/`. Informative context is in `docs/`, `reference/`, `reports/`.
4. **Extensibility:** `oeps/` provides a formal extension process. `adapters/` provides provider extensibility. `profiles/` provides application extensibility.
5. **Provenance:** `reference/EXTRACTION_LOG.md` documents where content came from. `IMPLEMENTATION-EXPERIENCE.md` tracks who has implemented what.
